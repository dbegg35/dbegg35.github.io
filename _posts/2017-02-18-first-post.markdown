Hello world!  Now that I have that obligatory intro out of the way, who am I and what is Sudo MakeDev about?  Well, my name is David and if you can't tell from my the intro I'm a software developer.  I'm a bit of a late bloomer as a developer with about 4 years under my belt now.  I'm constantly learning about new features and growing my current knowledge off different programming languages, design patterns and practices.  As developers we're always trying to solve problems and the problem I'm trying to solve with Sudo MakeDev is a way to increasing my understanding of what I am learning.  With that in mind, I look forward to your receiving your feedback and input.
